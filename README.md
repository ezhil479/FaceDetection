Face Detection Use Case Using Haar Cascade FrontalFace Algorithm
Introduction:
•	Face detection identifies and localizes human faces in images or videos.
•	The Haar Cascade FrontalFace algorithm, based on cascading classifiers, is commonly used for this purpose due to its speed and reliability.
Steps for Implementation:
Converting Color Image to Grayscale:
•	Simplifies computations by reducing color information while retaining intensity data.
•	Use image processing libraries like OpenCV (cv2) to convert RGB/BGR images into grayscale using:
Loading Haar Cascade Classifier:
•	Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file for frontal face detection.
Detecting Faces and Obtaining Coordinates:
•	Identify faces in the grayscale image by analyzing patterns like edges, lines, and textures.
Drawing Rectangles Around Detected Faces:
•	Visualize the detected faces by marking their locations in the original image.
